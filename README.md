### Prerequisites

- Python installed on your system. You can download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. Run the script with Python:

### Converting to Executable 📦

To convert `auto_clicker.py` into a standalone executable file, we use PyInstaller.

1. Install PyInstaller:

```

2. Navigate to your script's directory.
3. Run PyInstaller with the following command:

```shell
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed auto_clicker.py
```

4. Find your `.exe` file in the `dist` directory.

### Usage Tips 📝
